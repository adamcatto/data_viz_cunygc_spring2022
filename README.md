# Adam Catto Data Visualizaiton Homeworks, Spring 2022

This repository is set up to house the visualizations I create during Lev Manovich's Data Visualization course at the CUNY Graduate Center, Spring 2022. Currently, this repository is structured to have two files for each homework: (1) an `.ipynb` file which contains a Jupyter notebook with all the code and (interactive) visualizations, and (2) a `.md` (markdown) file explaining where to find the different components of the visualization requirements (as opposed to having to sift through the portions of code and Pandas dataframe outputs.

Note that none of the data files are available in this repository – I set up a line in the `.gitignore` file to discard any CSV files. However, I may end up adding them later if appropriate.
