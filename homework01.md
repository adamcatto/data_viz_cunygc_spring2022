# Homework 01

There are 3 requirements to this homework: (1) visualize the time-series for Internet usage per country, (2) visualize the time-series for cell phone usage per country, (3) visualize the latest year of cell phone usage per country, in a hierarchical fashion using geographical information.

For (1), see the output of Cell 7 in `homework01.ipynb`. For (2), see the output of Cell 14 in `homework01.ipynb`. For (3), see the output of Cell 16 in `homework01.ipynb`. Note that for (3) some countries did not have information for the latest year (2019), so I interpolated from the latest year available in those cases.
